/*
Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics.
Here’s what the class should do: 
1. Construct a class called Patient
2. Store a String name for the patient
3. Store weight and height for patient as doubles
4. Construct a new patient using these values
5. Write a method called BMI which returns the patient’s BMI as a double. BMI can be calculated as
   BMI = ( Weight in Pounds / ( Height in inches x Height in inches ) ) x 703
6. Next, construct a class called “Patients” and create a main method. Create a Patient object and assign 
   some height and weight to that object. Display the BMI of that patient.
